## Supported Keyboards
- [Ergodash](../../keyboards/omkbd/ergodash/rev1/keymaps/khoang65)

## Features

Code for (currently windows-only) VIM-like emulation: VIMDOWS lol
- Heavily based on the `ergodox_ez/vim` keymap
- changed to be more robust, to work with windows, and added additional features and functionality
  
Can be paired with (optional) tapdance code to mimic VIM's `d` and `y` single tap
